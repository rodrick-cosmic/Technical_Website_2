                   On the left side, I have an infographic taken from visual.ly, the infographic depicts Neo's journey through the first film's key events. I like this illustration because it is such a condensed version of the first movie's story events. The visualization, however, I believe fails in terms of operating in a clear and concise manner, because upon first glance it does not effectively communicate the information it is trying to relay. 
                   At least, for someone who is not familar or is a nerd about the movie and it's general plot. The illustration, is a bit clunky and the visuals are slightly all over the place, even for me who is an avid fan of the film and knows the plot the infographic is extremely incoherent and confusing. 
                   I use this example, though, because I think as far as visualizations for the movie go this was one of the better ones.

                        This visualization however is one of the absolute best ones I came across, essentially it is a mind map that is centered on Neo, the main character of the Matrix films, which radiates outwards demonstrating Neo's relationships from the most important and intimate to the least important and distant. 
                        The illustration is very in-depth, in that it is able to display all the interconnectedness of the characters within the movies.

                      <p>
                       Another interesting aspect of this illustration is how it also catalogues the characters closeness with Neo by colors. 
                       For example, in the depiction, Neo is the biggest bubble (Light orange) while Trinity (Neo's love interest) and Morpheus (Neo's mentor) are depicted as Dark Orange bubbles closely related to Neo.
                       One interesting aspect I was unable to take a screenshot of was how the relative paths of the characters connect to each other based on the color of the relation.

                        Another bit that better encapsulates the website and illustration as a whole, is Forest Gump, which if you have not seen it yet is a very complex story about a man who is seemingly larger than life. In the movie the tituluar Forest meets a vast array of people in his lifetime and all of them play a part in his journey and I think this illustration does a good job of reflecting this.
                        Ultimately I decided to rather go with my original idea of grossing figures and because of how specific my original graph was I decided to have it a bit more open-ended in the sense that it would not only include stats for the matrix films but grossing figures for a variety of films.
