                    What you are seeing here is, a still image of an ascii animation of a man riding a horse. The original video is an ASCII rendered animation of Muybridge galloping horse, running on an (emulated) Apple IIe.
                    I think in terms of ASCII art this is definitely one of the better ones I have seen, I like how fluid it looked in motion, and again it would have been great to implement on my site but the main issue was again it served no purpose and did very little to aid the site apart from looking cool.
                    And as we already know, this course is not about looking cool, at least without sound justification that is.

                        Another avenue I wanted to explore was the idea of ASCII art in a 3D capacity. I think this interested me because I have always had a fascination with 3D modeling and just 3D art in general so I thought what better way to implement this than by having an online ASCII generator. The intial thinking was maybe having a generator that created things procedurely or rather, at complete random.

                       The biggest inspiration for this came from an ASCII Art Generator by Tamino Martinius, the generator basically randomised a set of faces and would display a new face every few seconds. I liked this idea and really started playing around with it until I hit a brick wall. The brick wall came in the shape of how I would implement the 3D aspect to a procedurally generated interface.
                       The short answer is I decided to crank down the heat a bit and maybe try focus my artwork on something that relates to my site better.

                        It is often said that dice represent a means of control, or at least the illusion of control. I think given the subject matter of my website it is more than apt that it's data art section is in the most meta way possible an illustration depicting a symbol that has long been associated with ideas regarding fate, luck, control and even the lack thereof.
                        Intially I had no idea what I wanted to do for my data art without compromising the website's overall aesthetic and thematic elements. I think a dice was a nice little compromise because the dice was not only a interactive piece of data art but more importantly, it ties in with the overall thematic element of my site being related to the fate-like nature of the Matrix.
